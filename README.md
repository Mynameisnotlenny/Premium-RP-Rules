- Claiming someone "looked at you funny"
- Killing individuals based on their clothing color, vehicle color, or jewelry
- Killing on sight 
# Vehicle DeathMatch (VDM)
- Using a vehicle as a weapon against other players or other vehicles is not allowed. If you are chasing another vehicle as a civilian or criminal, give yourself enough room to prevent an accidental or unintentional collision. High latency or packet loss is not an excuse to violate this rule.
- Using a vehicle as a weapon is only allowed as a last resort option - players are required to exhaust all other options beforehand.
# Value of Life, Property, and Freedom
- Players are required to act in a rational manner and value their life & well being, personal safety, personal property, and freedom. Specific violations include:
- Purposely killing yourself to avoid police custody
- Purposely driving your vehicle into a body of water. This may result in a complete loss of the vehicle from the player's garage, if it is determined to be done intentionally to avoid charges.
- Committing brazen crimes that would surely result in death or jail time, e.g. killing or shooting someone in front of a cop
- Refusing to cooperate with a robbery and preventing loss of items by purposely dying
# Unrealistic Driving
- Driving a vehicle in an unrealistic manner is not allowed. An example of this would be like driving a supercar up a mountain.
# Unrealistic Roleplay
- Players must act and behave in a realistic manner. The follow common examples:
- Killing your friend in police custody to avoid charges

# Metagaming
- Acting on or using information that your character wouldn't know within roleplay isn’t allowed.
# New Life Rule (NLR)
- Players who die at a hospital (fully respawned) cannot remember or act on any information in the scene that led up to their death. This includes, but is not limited to:
- The identity of the people involved in your death
- Any vehicles in the proximity of your death. Going back to recover your vehicle after dying is not allowed. In general, players cannot return to the scene for 20 minutes after respawning. The bleedout or death timer does not count towards this requirement.
# Robbing Players
- Robbing players for items they currently have on them is allowed. With that said you need to keep the area you are robbing in realistic. For example, if it is daytime rob them in an alleyway or a not populated area. Areas marked as 'high crime areas' means people can rob you on sight, day or night. In addition you can not rob people who are currently working a legal job. This rule will only be in place if you are reasonably currently working a legal job. Staff will use their discretion when dealing with violations. Limitations to player robberies include:
- Forcing someone to withdraw money at a bank or ATM is not allowed.
- The maximum amount of clean money you can take off another player is $10,000.
- There are no quantity restrictions on illegal items.
# Scamming Players

- Doing donuts and/or revving your engine in front of police
- Speeding down the road repeatedly in front of police
- Shooting players in front of police intentionally
# Crimes in Unrealistic Areas
- Committing crimes in broad daylight, in unlikely areas for crime is not allowed. Simply put, if the crime is unthinkable or extremely improbable in real life, it is not allowed. This rule mainly applies to shooting in 'nice' areas, or areas that would otherwise be considered safe and not a crime hotspot. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Downtown Los Santos
- Vinewood
- In front of police stations or hospitals
-Staff will make the final determination on whether a location is considered unrealistic or not. Players are required to exercise discretion and use their best judgment when it comes to this rule. We will not entertain any arguing about this rule. Generally, the reasonable person test will be applied. Providing some YouTube video, news article, or any other anecdotal evidence will not be a valid excuse or justification for violating this rule.
# Exploiting / Cheating
- Any form of exploiting will result in severe consequences to be determined by staff. This includes taking advantage of bugs instead of reporting the issue. Additionally, using any form of third party hardware or software that gives a player an unfair advantage can be considered exploiting, powergaming, or cheating.
- Failure to Report
- Players who knowingly exploit or use a bug to their advantage are subject to a complete account reset along with additional punishments, at staff discretion, if it is determined they failed to report the issue for personal gain.
# Threatening Staff Action and Community Disrespect
- Anyone who tells another player they will be punished in one way or another by staff is considered breaking character. Punishments may vary based on the severity of the threat. 
- Going Out of Character (OOC)
- Breaking character includes statements such as:
- "I've got this on clip/bodycam"
- "You're getting reported"
- "Just wait until X staff member hears about this"
- "I'm on the job"
- "I'm calling an admin"
- "You're going to get banned"
- Making any comments that have no logical context or place in RP situations.
# Combat Logging
- Leaving during a roleplay situation to avoid arrest, death, or robbery is not allowed. Additionally, leaving to avoid or bypass the respawn timer is not allowed. Staff will issue punishments to anyone suspected of doing so.
# Misuse of calladmin
- We will not respond to any assists that fall under these categories:
- Vague and unhelpful, such as "please come", "I need help now", "admin help", etc.
- Asking for any staff member specifically, without any further information
- RDM. Video evidence is required, see below. The only exception is for mass RDM where it is clear what is happening and no evidence is required.
- Duplicate or multiple assists for the same reason
- Anyone who places such assists is subject to blacklisting, a warning, community service, or even a ban. We are more than willing to help, but do not waste our time or staff resources.
# Discord Conduct
- Reporting a Player
- Players are responsible for reporting other players for rule violations. Video evidence is required, staff will close any reports that have insufficient evidence. We will not entertain any reports that have insufficient evidence. Videos cannot be edited, trimmed, or otherwise obfuscated to mask any rule violations committed by the reporting party.
# Retaliatory Reporting
- We will not accept reports that are made after someone (or their friend) is punished. Player reports must be issued in a timely manner, within 24 hours of the violation occurring. The staff team will have the final say on whether to accept any reports that exceed this time requirement.
- Complaining about Rule Violations
- Anyone who complains about a player or gang breaking rules in a public channel will receive a mute, timeout, or a guild ban. We don't care how annoyed, angry, or upset you are about another player or gang in game -- either report them with the appropriate video evidence, or don't say anything at all. Nothing can be done if people complain in Discord without providing any actionable evidence. 
# Discouraging Reports & Witness Intimidation
- Anyone who makes any comments, whether in the guild or in-game, about a report issued by another player will receive a permanent mute from the guild, or possibly a ban in-game.
- This rule is in place to prevent players from discouraging others from issuing reports. We rely on player reports to address issues and remove problematic players. Anyone who tries to obstruct or degrade the effectiveness of this process is violating this rule.
- This includes, but is not limited to the following:
- Calling someone or an entire gang a 'ticket warrior'
- Calling someone a snitch for reporting a rule violation
- Implying any in-game retaliation for reporting misconduct
- Bringing up the fact someone reported another player in-game
- Anything that would discourage people from reporting another player
# Staff Discretion
- Staff will have the final decision on whether to accept a report or not. Anyone who acts angrily, complains, or whines about action taken (or not taken) on a report is subject to the following possible punishments:
- Blacklisted from making new tickets
- Muted from sending messages
- Banned from the guild entirely
# Respect & Professionalism
- Players who submit tickets are required to maintain a level of courtesy and professionalism towards the community moderators and staff team. We will not tolerate any disrespect, name-calling, or any hostility in the tickets.
